For the 2022 NeurIPS workshop "Has it Trained Yet? A Workshop for Algorithmic Efficiency in Practical Neural Network Training" we conducted a survey to gather insights on the current training practices within the community. The poll was distributed through the workshop website, Twitter, email, and at the in-person NeurIPS event.

The survey's results can be found in the [PDF](PollResults.pdf) in this repository.
